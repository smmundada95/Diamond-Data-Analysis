# Diamond-Data-Analysis

In this repository I will be analysing the Diamonds dataset from Kaggle which can be found at: 
https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds

I will be using Machine Learning algorithms to build models that best predict the price of a diamond, given its attributes such as cut, clarity, dimensions etc.

As a conclusion, I will compare the results of these algorithms and display a comparison chart of their r^2 values.

I am a beginner in the field of Data Science, and with this repository, I wish to help other students like me who want a place to start learning from.
Feel free to follow the steps that I will be carefully documenting in this series of analysis.

Update: I have now analysed this dataset using Multiple Linear Regression, next, I will be approaching the problem with the Random Forest algorthim.
